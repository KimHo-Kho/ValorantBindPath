# ValorantBindPath
Generate a path for attackers on Bind for the Valorant map. 

BindPath is a Python application that assists in generating random paths 
and suggesting strategies for the game Valorant, specifically focusing on
the map Bind. The application starts by allowing users to choose a 
starting and ending point. The first three steps of the generated path 
are random with weighted edges, followed by utilizing Breadth-First Search 
(BFS) to reach the designated site.
